So this past week was the first week of school, and the first week of Software Engineering. Since it *was* just the first week, we didn't do much - went over the syllabus and began talking about [Collatz](http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/downing/cs373/projects/Collatz.html). 

Thankfully, the [Collatz](http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/downing/cs373/projects/Collatz.html) project is actually something I've done before, in Professor Downing's [Object-Oriented Programming](http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/downing/cs371p/) (OOP) class last semester. Everything is the exact same, from the repo file structure to the cache optimization. The only difference is that this time, it will be done in Python, not C++. So, although the first couple weeks in this class will probably feel a bit repetitive, I'm excited for what's to come after.

Starting next week, I'm going to try and knock out the project and turn it in early, so I have more time to work on other classes - chapter readings which I have already fallen behind on. I'm also going to *really* make an effort to do the assigned readings, something I did not do in OOP - a decision that cost me a handful of quiz points, and honestly might have made a whole letter grade difference (more on that later).

Overall, I'm excited for what's to come. I've heard a lot of great things about this class, especially the big group project later on. I was told by a friend who took this class last semester that the group project is actually not all that time-consuming, since it is split between 5-6 people. I'm still a little skeptical, however -- the bulk of my web development experience is on the front-end side, so the fact that we're going to be implementing a database along with the web app is a little intimidating. 

**Tip of the ~~week~~ semester**: **_Do the extra credit_**. Last semester in OOP, if I had just bothered to spend maybe 30 minutes a week writing a blog post, and *at most* an hour at some point in the semester to set up a Seelio profile, it would've made the difference between an A and a B. Or if I had just took a little bit of time to actually read the assigned readings to do better on a few quizzes. Or if I had just studied a little harder for each of the tests. Every point in this class counts, and it'd be silly to leave free/easy points on the table.

**Tip of the week**: [Dillinger](http://dillinger.io/) is a really nice markdown editor, and is what I'm using right now to type this blog post. Also, [*this* blog post](http://blog.marksteve.com/deploy-a-flask-application-inside-a-digitalocean-droplet) ("Deploying a Flask application inside a DigitalOcean droplet") by Mark Samson was really useful when I was playing around with a Flask app before the start of the semester. Even though we're going to be using [Rackspace](https://www.rackspace.com/) instead of [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/) for a host, the instructions are the same. I honestly didn't know what Flask was, or even what "deploying" meant, so it is definitely for beginners who are completely foreign to the whole "web application" thing.
